# LabSeries

This project was part of the course 'Software Evolution' during Msc of Software Engineering. It consists of 2 parts.

As for the first part, by running method 'runMetrics' in softMetrics.rsc file, someone can get metrics about a specific
project that is specified at the 1st line of the method. The metrics that are extracted are volume, unit size, cycl. complexity
and duplication.

As for the second part, by running method 'runVisualization' in visualization.rsc file, the user can get a visualization of the
clones that were found in a specific project. The project can again be specified in the beginning of this method. A documentation
about how the visualization works can be found in visualization.rsc file.
